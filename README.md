# Phone-Manufacturing-Investment-Optimizer

This project is designed to assist a phone manufacturing startup in making strategic decisions on capital allocation between machine investments and marketing expenditures. The model optimizes machine purchases and advertising investments to maximize cash flows over a 20-year period, with a cap of up to 5 machines.

###Features
Demand Forecasting: Computes year-over-year demand growth based on initial demand and advertising investment.

Production Capacity Management: Tracks the lifespan of each machine, ensuring accurate output and financial projections.

Revenue and Cost Calculations: Calculates yearly revenue based on production, price per unit, and operational costs.

Cash Flow Analysis: Projects annual cash flows and computes the net present value (NPV) of these flows for a 20-year forecast period.

Investment Constraints: Allocates budget between machine purchase and marketing based on available capital, allowing for dynamic adjustments.


###Model Inputs

Production & Machine Costs: Set number of phones per machine, cost per machine, and other fixed expenses.

Machine Lifecycle: Adjust machine lifespan to determine when output will cease and account for salvage value.

Market Variables: Include initial demand, advertising growth impact, and interest rates to reflect real-world market conditions.

Variable Costs: Set the cost to produce each phone and calculate total production expenses.


###Model Outputs

Cash Flow Projections: Provides cash flow details for each year up to 20 years.

Net Present Value (NPV): Calculates NPV for cash flows, helping assess the project’s overall profitability.


###Usage

This model can be customized by modifying inputs to see how changes in machine costs, production rates, demand growth, or other parameters affect the company’s financial outcomes.

The model has been created in both excel and python.
